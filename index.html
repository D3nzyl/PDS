        With the use of datasets from <a href="https://data.gov.sg/" target="_blank">data.gov.sg</a> I have created 6 graphs with insightful analysis. 
        This was done by using jupyter notebook and python with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, 
        numpy and seaborn. Through this project, I have gain the fundamental skills to code applications 
        to retrieve, clean and visualize data using the Python programming language. As well as, the 
        ability to apply Python packages to describe data, explore data and to create visualizations to 
        gain useful insights from it.

        With the dataset of “Doctors per 10000 Total Population” I have created a line graph to show the 
        Medical Professionals in Singapore between 1990 to 2019. Through this graph I can tell that there 
        has been a general steady increase of Medical Professionals from 1990 with 48 per 10000 total 
        population to 2019 with 104 per total population. However, between 2008 and 2009, there was a sharp 
        increase of 15 medical professionals per 10000 total population.

        With the dataset of “Government Health Expenditure” I have created a bar graph to display the operating 
        expenditure and development expenditure in healthcare. With the bar graph, I can tell that there has 
        been a constant increase in Operating and Development Expenditure on Health from 2006 to 2017. With a 
        significantly larger amount on the Operating Expenditure compared to the Development Expenditure. 
        However, there was a decrease in Development Expenditure between 2009 and 2010 with a drop of S$226 million.

      <p class="mx-auto text">
        With the use of the 2 datasets above, I created a data frame for “Medical Professionals and Government 
        Health Expenditure”. I plotted the data onto a scatterplot to allow a simple data analysis of the 
        relationship between the Government Health Expenditure and Number of Medical Professionals. From this 
        scatter graph, I can conclude that there is a positive relationship between Government Health Expenditure 
        and the Number of Medical Professionals. This means that as the government spent more on Health Expenditure, 
        the number of Medical Professionals in Singapore will increase.

      <p class="mx-auto text">
        With the dataset of “Rainfall Monthly Total“ I have created a bar graph with a colour map which allow the 
        user to easily find out which has the most and least amount based on the darkness of the colour of the bar. 
        From the bar graph, I can tell that the trend of rainfall is that it is consistent in the middle of the year 
        and it increases during the end and at the start of the year. The highest months are December, November, and 
        January. The lowest month is February.

        With the dataset of “Dengue Outbreak Statistics” I have created a line chart with a vertical line to 
        highlight the year with the most outbreak. Through this chart, I can tell that trend of dengue outbreak 
        between 2007 to 2015 is not consistent. From 2007 to 2009 there was a gradual decrease in dengue outbreaks 
        from 180.6 to 83.9 dengue cases per 100,000 population. From to 2009 to 2012 the dengue outbreak stayed 
        stable. Between 2012 to 2013, there a huge increase in number of dengue outbreak from 82.7 to 404.9 dengue 
        cases per 100,000 population. After 2013, the dengue outbreak has been gradually decreasing.

        With the use of the 2 datasets above, I created a data frame for “Dengue Outbreak And Total amount of 
        Rainfall”. With the data, I plotted a scatterplot to perform a simple data analysis of the relationship 
        between the amount of rainfall yearly and the number of dengue outbreaks. From this scatter plot, I can 
        tell that there is slim or no correlation between the amount of total amount of rainfall each year and 
        the number of dengue outbreaks. This is because the best fit line is almost a horizontal line. Due to many 
        points being in a straight line with multiple anomalies.
